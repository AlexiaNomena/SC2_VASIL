# Hands-on session Day 4: Cross-immunization

## Introduction
In this hands-on session, we will compute the cross-immunization between several variants, the expected number of susceptibles to a given variant, and the relative fitness of a given variant. We will use Jupyter Notebook. 

## Input files

All input files can be found [here](https://github.com/AlexiaNomena/SC2_VASIL). Please download the whole repository.
The input file for this hands on is `Hands_On.ipynb`

### 1. Mutation profiles
Mutation profiles can be found and extracted from [outbreak.info](https://outbreak.info/)
Please visit [here](https://outbreak.info/compare-lineages?pango=JN.1&pango=EG.5&gene=S&threshold=75&nthresh=1&dark=false) to check the differences in the S protein between the two variants JN.1 and EG.5.
